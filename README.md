## Development

### Quick guide

1. Run `start-local-env.sh`. This will set up development environment and runs all needed commands. Script will also tell if you are missing some tooling listed below.
2. _(OPTIONAL)_ If you want to test with realish users, set up `user-service` and make sure that there's a service for exam-archive, might need to change the permission bits to `770`. By default, the service will just skip authentication and log you in. If local user service cookie is detected, exam-archive tries to authenticate against it.
3. Then go to <http://127.0.0.1:9000>

### Other good to know commands

- `run-prod.sh` will start prod-like environment locally for testing Docker image. There is `APP_ENV=development` enabled for bypassing user service authentication.
- `run-security-scan.sh` runs ZAProxy's zap-full-scan.py against app. Mainly used in CI, but also working locally.
- `run-tests.sh` runs Playwright test suite against app.
- `seed-dev-db.sh` runs database seeds against local development database. Only needed if you want to have some development test data. Tests handles seeding itself.

### Needed tools and dependencies

- docker and docker-compose
- tmux
- curl
- shasum
- jq
- npm (start-local-env.sh will take care of this with nvm)
- Prettier formatter extension for your editor

### Adding more test files

By default, the local minio s3 is seeded with one PDF and one JPG. You can just upload more files, or see `docker/minio.Dockerfile` and `docker/minio-docker-entrypoint.sh` for how to add more files the Minio image we build. If you add a file, you can then modify `seeds/exams.js` with the correct file name. Make the file an uuidv4 or something.

### Seeding database with real data

1. Download the development database dump (`db.sql`) from [here](https://github.com/TKOaly/exam-archive-dev-db-dump)
2. Start the database and Adminer:
   - `docker-compose up -d db adminer`
3. Open Adminer (navigate to <http://localhost:9003>) and log in with the credentials in `docker-compose.yml`, by default they are:
   | Key      | Value      |
   | -------- | -----------|
   | System   | PostgreSQL |
   | Server   | `db`       |
   | Username | `tarpisto` |
   | Password | `tarpisto` |
   | Database | `tarpisto` |
4. Click on Import on the left sidebar and upload `db.sql`
5. Further possible migrations are runned while starting app.

## Docker warning

The `.dockerignore` is configured to work as a whitelist so if you add new files or folders which you want to include in the Docker image, update [`.dockerignore`](https://github.com/TKOaly/exam-archive-new/blob/master/.dockerignore).

## Deployment

### Manual infra setup with Terraform

1. `cd tf`
2. Set correct AWS CLI profile

   ```shell
   export AWS_PROFILE=default
   export TF_VAR_aws_profile=default
   ```

   - Note: if you've created another `aws` cli profile (e.g. have separate profile for personal and for tkoaly), change `default` to that profile's name
3. `terraform plan`
   - Will ask for `var.image_version_tag`, set to the deployment tag (latest version in Github Releases), specify **without** `v`, e.g. `1.2.30`.
     - If tired of doing it again, `export TF_VAR_image_version_tag=1.2.30`
4. `terraform apply`

### CI to production

To deploy a new release to production, author a new Github Release. Use semver. Make sure the version string is prefixed with `v`, e.g. `v1.2.30` instead of `1.2.30`. The deployment script does a string replace for this, so if you want to release non-v-prefixed versions, update the Github action workflow.
